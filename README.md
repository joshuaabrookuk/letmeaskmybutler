# Let Me Ask My Butler

LMAMB is a clone of [Let Me Google That](http://letmegooglethat.com/) with one small difference, a nod to the classic search engine AskJeeves.

Here's a mock up I made, which may be aniamted in the future.

**Senario:**

Your friend asks you a question online, you don't know the awnser but your butler might:

1. You 'ask your butler' and enter a query.
2. Sharable link is generated, send to a friend.
3. When the link so open the web page 'mimics' your actions: <br>
a). Mouse moves to click the form and waits idle.<br>
b). Your search query is typed in one character at a time.<br>
c). The cursor lazily pans over and submits the search.
4. The page redirects.

Things I still need to work on:
1. Layout design for scalablity
2. Cleaner JavaScript
3. Further optimisation and code clean
